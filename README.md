# This is a simple utility to access and edit files in the directory.
I was inspired to write this when i felt it increasingly difficult to make small changes in live PHP websites.
This shell can create new files, edit files and read files.
also since there were chances that my changes can break the whole website, i also added a rollback command to reverse to previous code.
